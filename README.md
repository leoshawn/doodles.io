## Why use Doodles.io?

In many situations, we've often found it difficult to explain a certain design, shape or layout through words alone. Although there are plenty of solutions to this, we tried to find a place where we could create and share a doodle within seconds. It didn't exist, so we created Doodles.io.

You can create doodles either by creating an account or simply drawing on the blank canvas. Doodles have no expiration date, so feel free to embed them without the worry of your work of art ever disappearing.

## How do I use Doodles.io?

The first screen you're greeted with is a blank doodle. Simply begin typing in the 'title' field or start drawing on the notepad to get started. As soon as you've written/drawn something, the URL will change and your doodle will be instantly saved. This URL can then be sent to a lucky recipient or shared via social networks.

And there we go, you've just created your first doodle. In seconds.
