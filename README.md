# Doodles.io

Doodles.io is a free service that allows you to send quick drawings to friends, colleagues or clients. Sometimes, describing something with words can be difficult. *If only you had a pad and paper...*

## Why use Doodles.io?

In many situations, we've often found it difficult to explain a certain design, shape or layout through words alone. Although there are plenty of solutions to this, we tried to find a place where we could create a quick doodle within seconds. There wasn't one, so we created one.

You can create doodles either by creating an account or simply drawing on the blank canvas. Anonymous and owned doodles have no expiration date, so feel free to embed them without the worry of it ever disappearing.

## How do I use Doodles.io?

The first screen you're greeted with is a blank doodle. Simply begin typing in the 'title' field or start drawing on the notepad to get started. As soon as you've written/drawn something, the URL changes and your doodle is instantly saved. This URL can then be shared or sent to a lucky recipient.

And there we go, you've just created your first doodle! In seconds.
